# Instachrome

This is basically a simple Instapaper extension that doesn't suck ass and actually works. This also allows me to get rid this lame ass bookmarklet that is sitting in my hidden bookmarks bar.


# Installation

1. Menu > Tools > Extensions
2. Turn on developer mode.
3. Load Unpacked Extension.

# Contribution

Likely not needed, swag on if you care though.
